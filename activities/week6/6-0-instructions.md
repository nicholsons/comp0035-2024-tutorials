## Pre-requisites

The activities assume that you have forked the COMP0035 tutorials repository, cloned it to your computer, and set up a
project with a virtual environment within your IDE (VS Code or PyCharm).

following.

- In PyCharm try menu option Git > Pull  (or Git > Synch)
- In VS Code click on the source code control icon on the left side panel, then when the source code control pane opens,
  click on the three dots and select Pull (or Synch).

There are other methods, look in the Help for either PyCharm or VSCode.
