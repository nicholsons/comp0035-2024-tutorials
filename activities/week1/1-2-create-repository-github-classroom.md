# Activity 2: Create a repository by accepting a GitHub Classroom assignment

GitHub Classroom provides a way for you to create repository so that it can then be accessed by yourself, the course
tutor and PGTAs.

You can directly access the classroom, though you don't need to do this as you will be given a link to the classroom
assignments when you need to use it.

All coursework repositories for COMP0034 and COMP0035 are created using GitHub Classroom.

You click on a URL that creates a copy of a template repository with some starter files that you will need for the
coursework.

Repositories that are created this way are stored in an organisation called **ucl-comp0035**, not in your personal
GitHub account. They are created as **private** which in this case means _you, the course tutor and PGTAs_ can see
your code; but not any other students.
