# Styling charts

During the data exploration and preparation phase charts, or plots, can be used to help you understand the data.

At this stage, you are not creating a polished chart intended for a particular audience.

You don't need to spend time formatting these charts, however some formatting may be needed beyond the examples included
in the previous activities.

The [pandas visualisation documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#plot-formatting)
gives you plot formatting guidance and examples. This includes:

- [x and y labels](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#controlling-the-labels)
- [displaying the legend](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#controlling-the-legend)
- [subplots](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#plot-formatting)
- [custom formatters for timeseries plots](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html#custom-formatters-for-timeseries-plots)
